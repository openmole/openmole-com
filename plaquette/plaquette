			A free and open-source project

OpenMOLE is developped by the Complex System community. It relies on the 4 pilars of the open-source movement, meaning that the code can freely be executed, studied, modified and redistributed.

This choice is part of the open science trend that we defend and which promotes the sharing and the reusabilty of code in scientific publications.
As it is usually the case in the open-source movement, OpenMOLE invites anyone to contribute to the project by:
- proposing helpful enhancements or use cases (shared with the community on the website),
- proposing development features,
- reporting bugs,
- developing plugins.

Access to: 
- the source code and the bug tracker (www.openmole.org),
- the user mailing list: users@list.openmole.org
- the development mailing list: devs@list.openmole.org

                             Large scale computing

- Compute transparently on multi-core machines, clusters, and grids: no particular knowledge is required to access massively parallel environments.

- Embed your own programs in less than 5 clicks (C, C++, Java, Scala, Scilab, R, Python, Netlogo, ...),
 
- Design your distributed process using a powerful workflow approach (loops, alternative processing, massive parallelism)

- Prototype your workflow locally and take advantage of the parallelism with no extra effort: the Zero-deployment approach does not require any installation step on remote machines.

- Use OpenMOLE as a scalable computing engine for your web portal (ex: bioemergences.eu is powered by OpenMOLE).

                            Explore your models

- Embed your model

- design your model exploration :
	+ design of experiments, 
	+ stochastic model replication,
	+ calibration, 
	+ sensitivity analysis,
	+ ...

- distribute the numerous executions of your model to explore it
	+ on your multi-core computer // Speed up around 4
	+ on a multi-core server // Speed up around 50
	+ on a cluster           // Speed up arround 200
	+ on a grid 		// Speed up > 1000

- reuse your experiments on several models

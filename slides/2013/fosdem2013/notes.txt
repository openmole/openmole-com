–  Complex systems are often difficult to tackle (either
experimentally or by though experiments)
–  Dynamic non-linear interactions may contradict our intuition
–  We need tools to explore the behavior of the system and to
explain the emergent comportment


“To an observer B, an object A* is a model of an object A to the
extent that B can use A* to answer questions that interest him
about A.”
(Marvin Minsky, 1995)


The “model triad”: To be a model, an object (system, equations,
software, ...) needs to be linked to a triplet of elements:
–  <Objet, Question, Observer>
–  The observer is the link between model domain to object domain
•  The model must be used to answer questions: it is a scientific instrument
–  It must be used like an instrument (experimental method)
–  But models depend on the question more than on the object
–  It is not an instrument “like the others” (e.g. a microscope)

"The decisive thing with modeling is not the model per se, but what the model and working with the model does to our mind."

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You can start OpenMOLE from the command line

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
OpenMOLE is a web application

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It automatically opens a new tab in your web browser

4
00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:20.617
The menu on the left is your workspace

5
00:00:20.617 --> 00:00:22.610
You can manage your files from there

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.610
OpenMOLE projects bear the .oms extension

7
00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:31.380
Specify the docker image to fetch from Docker hub

8
00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:38.280
And the parameters as you would on the command line

9
00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:45.980
Let's now define the execution environment

10
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.116
Login and head node are compulsory

11
00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:54.383
wallTime and other parameters are optional

12
00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.780
click on the lock icon to open the authentication menu

13
00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:01.784
Enter your login, head node and path to your SSH private key

14
00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:03.780
The green OK denotes a successful authentication

15
00:01:11.283 --> 00:01:16.280
We specify the task to run on the environment (PBS here)

16
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.150
And how many instances will be executed

17
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850
Click Play to start the experiment

18
00:01:33.662 --> 00:01:36.660
The execution panel pops up automatically

19
00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:42.020
Click on Env for more information on the remote environments

20
00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:49.390
And then details to dig into a specific environment (here PBS)

21
00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.420
Number and size of uploaded files are updated on the fly

22
00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:07.520
3 jobs have been submitted to the underlying PBS environment

23
00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.920
We can verify that 3 jobs are in the queue of the cluster

24
00:02:20.552 --> 00:02:24.550
The interface is refreshed when jobs start running

25
00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:32.950
Let's verify on the cluster

26
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.370
Finished jobs are also automatically reported

27
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.270
Each job's output is automatically retrieved upon completion

28
00:02:51.603 --> 00:02:54.600
And the cluster's queue is now empty!

29
00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:05.120
Result files are downloaded from the cluster

30
00:03:07.894 --> 00:03:09.894
And the whole execution is now finished

31
00:03:11.661 --> 00:03:15.660
We can visualize each job's output

32
00:03:22.627 --> 00:03:27.620
Results have been copied to the specified folder (hook)
